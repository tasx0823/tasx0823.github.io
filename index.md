## Sun Xiao's Homepage

I'm Xiao Sun, currently a master student in the Institute of Computer Science & Technology of Peking University (<a href="www.icst.pku.edu.cn">ICST</a>), also a member of Character Shape Computing Lab (<a href="www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cscl">CSCL</a>).

### Experience

* PhD Candidate in Computer Science (09/2016 - present) <br/>
School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University

* Bachelor’s Degree in Chemistry (09/2012 - 07/2016) <br/>
Yuanpei College, Peking University

* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science(09/2014 - 07/2016) <br/>
School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University

### Research Interest
My research interests focus on Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.
I have done some works which apply deep learning techniques on character shape synthesis, including
* Character image generation
* Character contour simplification
* Handwritting synthesis

Currently, I'm working on some character image/skeleton/contour generation projects.
